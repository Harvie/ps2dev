# Arduino ps2dev library
This library allows arduino to emulate ps2 keyboard and/or mouse, so you can implement your own ps2 keyboard or whatever...

I want to improve this, provide better documentation and arduino library manager package for it...

# Notes

 * If you are implementing keyboard you should read the commands from computer quite often. I don't know how often, but 1 second is not enough. You will miss stuff like num/caps/scroll LED changes and maybe even more important stuff needed for proper ps2 protocol initialisation.
 * Calling `keyboard_handle(...);` each 10ms should be enough...
 * Serial debug is not intended to be enabled in production code. Use it only during development. Otherwise it might mess up the protocol timing.

# TODO

 * Add mode, where attachInterrupt() will be used to watch CLK pin instead of need to constantly poll it using available() or keyboard_handle()
 * Add mouse protocol handling directly to library
 * Add scancode table
 * Check against Arduino API style guide: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/APIStyleGuide
 * Check why there are occasional issues with PS2Keyboard library https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/PS2Keyboard
   * I've been using this to send keystrokes between two arduinos (from ps2dev to PS2Keyboard) and there are some issues (missed keystrokes). So i had to use SoftwareSerial.h instead, ditching the PS2 compatibility. We need to debug this...
